Car Plate Detection with YOLOv11
This project focuses on detecting vehicle license plates using the YOLOv11 object detection model. It utilizes a labeled image dataset to train and evaluate a high-performance deep learning model capable of identifying license plates in various car images.

üìÇ Dataset
The dataset includes images of vehicles along with corresponding annotations marking the position of license plates. The annotations are provided in Pascal VOC (XML) format and were converted into a format suitable for YOLO-based training.

üß∞ Tools and Frameworks
YOLOv11: An advanced object detection model known for its speed and accuracy, suitable for real-time applications.

Computer Vision Libraries: Used for image handling and visualization.

Data Processing Tools: Employed to analyze, split, and format the dataset.

Visualization Tools: Used to monitor training performance and prediction results.

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Overview
Dataset Acquisition
The dataset was obtained from an open-source platform and contains both images and their annotations.

Annotation Processing
Annotations were converted from VOC format to the YOLOv11-compatible format by normalizing the bounding boxes and assigning class labels.

Data Organization
The data was split into training and validation sets. Files were arranged according to YOLOv11‚Äôs required directory structure for seamless model training.

Model Training
YOLOv11 was trained using the prepared dataset over multiple epochs. Performance was tracked using standard metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and various loss indicators.

Model Evaluation
After training, the model was tested on a set of unseen validation images. Predicted bounding boxes were visualized to assess the model‚Äôs accuracy in identifying license plates.

üìà Results
The model showed strong performance in detecting license plates with high precision and recall.

Training metrics and graphs confirmed effective learning over time.

Visualization of predictions demonstrated the model's ability to generalize to new data.

üöÄ Future Work
Incorporate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read and extract license plate numbers.

Extend the model to support detection in live video streams.

Experiment with different YOLOv11 configurations and training settings for further improvements.
